\section{Used software}\label{app:software}
This document has been created with the use of several software tools and packages.

The document itself is typeset in \LaTeX{}~\cite{LaTeX,MiKTeX} using a slightly modified version of the \textit{TUDa-CI}~\cite{TUDa-CI,TUDa-CISteil}.
For bibliography management and citation formatting we use the Bib\LaTeX{}~\cite{BibLaTeX} package with the \textit{biber} backend~\cite{Biber}.
A multitude of other \LaTeX{} packages are used for various applications, \eg{}, \textit{axodraw2}~\cite{Collins:2016aya,axodraw2CTAN} for Feynman diagrams, 
\textit{glossaries/glossaries-extra}~\cite{glossaries,glossaries-extra} for acronyms, \textit{cleveref}~\cite{cleveref} for intelligent cross-referencing, and
 \textit{amsmath}~\cite{amsmath} for improved mathematical typesetting to name a few notable ones.

Parts of this thesis have been manually spell-checked using the dictionaries of \textsc{\TeX nic\allowbreak Center}~\cite{TeXnicCenter}, \textsc{Notepad++} \cite{npp}, and the language model \textsc{ChatGPT 4} \cite{ChatGPT4}.
Note that the latter has not been used to generate text passages. 
The text in this document has been compiled in accordance with the affidavit \dash{} \hyperref[chap:affidavit]{Erkl√§rungen laut Promotionsordnung} \dash{} and the disclaimers throughout this work, see also \cref{sec:publications}.

Plots and figures in this document have been created with \textit{Matplotlib}~\cite{Hunter:2007} and \WAM{}~\cite{Mathematica:12.1,Mathematica:13.0}.

The software and code used for symbolic and numeric computations is described and referenced in the main part of this work, see also \cref{app:auxFiles}.
