\section{Compact notations}\label{sec:compactNotations}
Throughout this work, we employ various compact notations to improve readability.

Compact notations and abbreviations related to computations in field space and in position/momentum space are discussed separately in \cref{app:FS} and \cref{app:fourier}.
Summation/integration over repeated internal indices/variables is implied in the usual manner.
When abbreviating elements of large sums or products, we adopt the \textit{Skeleton} notation of \WAMwR{} where $\skeleton{n}$ is used to represent a sequence of $n$ omitted elements.
