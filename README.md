> ### Abstract
>In this work, we study strongly interacting quantum field theories using the functional renormalization group (FRG) as our primary computational method.
>The goal is to facilitate FRG computations in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to study the phase structure of dense strong-interaction matter.
>The main part of this work is split into three chapters, differing in the space-time dimension of the theories under consideration.
>
>We begin by studying zero-dimensional theories, which ultimately involves solving ordinary integrals with complicated FRG flow equations. 
>Initially, this might seem like an unnecessarily convoluted way to solve a simple problem.
>However, it is this very fact – applying the FRG to such simple theories – that allows us to gain enormous insights into the FRG in a rigorous manner.
>Arguably, the most relevant development is the novel understanding of FRG flow equations in a fluid-dynamic context.
>This allows for the application of methods and concepts from the highly developed field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to the FRG.
>Two key findings are the identification of bosonic (fermionic) fluctuations as convective (source- or sink-like) contributions to the FRG flow and the resulting link between the CFD concept of numerical entropy and the irreversibility of non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) flows.
>These developments serve as a vital stepping stone facilitating the following applications.
>
>We proceed with computations in the (1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu (GN) model.
>We use it to study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (χSB) – a phenomenon vital to the understanding of QCD.
>Using the previously established CFD methods for the FRG, we study the effects of fermionic and crucially bosonic quantum and thermodynamic fluctuations on spontaneous χSB.
>The main result of this part of our research is that thermal bosonic fluctuations prevent χSB in the (1+1)-dimensional GN model.
>We further study inhomogeneous χSB indirectly using a stability analysis in mean-field (MF) approximation, i.e., considering only fermionic fluctuations.
>Our research helps to establish this method as a robust tool for both qualitative and quantitative statements about inhomogeneous χSB.
>
>We conclude the main part of this thesis with our studies of the (3+1)-dimensional Quark-Meson (QM) model, which we primarily consider as a low-energy effective theory of QCD.
>We focus on inhomogeneous chiral condensates by studying the QM model within the FRG framework, using a position-dependent ansatz for the chiral condensate, viz. the chiral density wave (CDW) for which we have been able to derive explicit FRG flow equations.
>We again investigate the effects of fluctuations on spontaneous χSB by solving those flow equations in RG-consistent MF calculations.
>Thus establishing contact with existing literature results for the QM model with CDW condensates.
>These computations – incorporating only fermionic fluctuations – are a first step towards a complete solution of the derived flow equations using our established CFD methods.
